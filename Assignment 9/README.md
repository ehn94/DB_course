### 1. Describe the setup of your experiment
I have used the small CSV files for this assignment, as I was not able to import the larger files into the Neo4j database. 
I was not able to get MySQL to run 

### 2. Present the execution time of each query for each of the 20 random nodes per database

### 3. Present the average and the median runtime of each of the queries per database
The average and median value is given in seconds. 

|   | Neo4  Average  | Neo4  Median | MySQL Average |   MySQL Median |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|getDepthOne:	|0.0032	|0.003	|0.02	|0.01	|
|getDepthTwo:	|0.00445	|0.004	|0.025	|0.01 |
|getDepthThree:	|0.0098	|0.007	|0.1 |0.05 |
|getDepthFour:	|0.3345	|0.032	|0.36 |0.05 |
|getDepthFive:	|0.14605	|0.16	|1.25	|0.06|

### 4. Give an explanation of the differences in your time measurements
